## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The `[specs]` extra requires `djangorestframework-services>=0.59.0` and
  `django-service-specs>=0.14.0`.
- The failure policy's default `reraise` set now includes the kernel's
  `NotPermitted` and `PrincipalUnavailable`, so a refusal from the kernel's
  dispatch, including a deactivated principal, ends the run as Django's and
  DRF's `PermissionDenied` do, rather than reaching the model as a failed tool
  call.
- The instructions block no longer names Django REST Framework.
  `AgentConventions.base` now opens "The following tools call this
  application's services and selectors." Every deployed agent reads this line
  on every step, so a deployment that pinned the old text will see the
  difference, and an override derived from the default, such as
  `AgentConventions().base.replace("Django REST Framework", ...)`, now replaces
  nothing.
- `SpecToolset` runs each call through the kernel's `dispatch` on the compiled
  spec, rather than through drf-services' `dispatch_spec`. What a model and a
  run see of that:
  - An argument no parameter declares is refused in the kernel's words, one
    line per key: `note: Unknown argument.` where it was
    `Unexpected argument(s): 'note'.`
  - A call's arguments are checked before its permissions, so a malformed call
    to a tool its caller may not use is handed back as a retry naming the
    argument, where it used to be refused with `PermissionDenied`.
  - A deactivated principal is refused with the kernel's
    `PrincipalUnavailable` before any permission check, and a spec's
    permission refusal may arrive as the kernel's `NotPermitted`. Both are
    logged at `WARNING` naming the tool, as DRF's `PermissionDenied` is.
  - A spec with no permissions, served by a toolset built with
    `require_permissions=False`, still runs unchecked, and only that spec: a
    spec that declares a check is asked it on every call.
  - A filter-owned `ordering` sent as one string reaches the FilterSet as the
    list its widget splits it into, an empty string as no sort.
  - `pool_seeds` registering `request` or `view` is refused with
    `ImproperlyConfigured` at the call, since each call registers both from
    the context `build_context` builds. It used to be accepted.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-10-21

### Added

- One package for Pydantic-AI agents in Django, in two halves. The agent host was
  published as `django-pydantic-agent`
  ([changelog](https://github.com/Artui/django-pydantic-agent/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md));
  `django_spec_agents.spec_tools`, behind the `[specs]` extra, was published as
  `djangorestframework-pydantic-ai`
  ([changelog](https://github.com/Artui/djangorestframework-pydantic-ai/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)).
  The package root never imports `spec_tools`, so the host installs and runs
  without the extra.
- `django_spec_agents.testing` holds the run-loop test doubles. It imports
  pydantic-ai only, and the package root does not import it. It replaces
  `spec_tools.testing`.

### Changed

- The store app's label is `django_spec_agents_store`, and its tables, named
  constraints and named indexes are named after it. One migration, `0001_initial`,
  creates them on a fresh database and, on one migrated through
  `django-pydantic-agent`'s store, renames its tables, named constraints, named
  indexes, PostgreSQL's `_like` index on the attachment file column, content types
  and migration records in place, so the upgrade is a single `migrate`. The other
  objects Django named itself keep their old names on PostgreSQL. A database short of
  that store's last migration is refused with a message naming it.
- `DESTRUCTIVE_METADATA_KEY` is `"django_spec_agents.destructive"`.
- The attachments toolset id is `django-spec-agents-attachments`.
- The `ImproperlyConfigured` raised when a model cannot be built, and the error
  `ToolFailurePolicy` logs when it converts a tool's failure, open with
  `django-spec-agents: `.
- The audit `ContextVar` is named `django_spec_agents.audit.execution`.
- The `[drf-mcp]` extra requires `djangorestframework-mcp-server>=0.53.1`, the
  release that requires `django-service-specs>=0.10.0`, so a selector raising
  `Http404` is a missing row on that route as it is through `spec_tools`.
- The enums and constants moved from `constants.py` to one module each under
  `django_spec_agents.types`; the root names are unchanged, and
  `django_spec_agents.constants` is gone.

### Fixed

- A registry tool whose name differs from its function's, through
  `@tool(name=...)` or a `ToolSpec` registered directly, is now offered to the
  model under its registered name. It was offered under the function's own name,
  so a destructive tool carrying such a name was never collected by `ToolGuard`
  and ran without approval under an enabled guard, and the audit record and tool
  catalog named it differently from each other. A `description=` override now
  reaches the model too; a tool with neither override is offered exactly what it
  was. **Anything that named such a tool by its function name must now use the
  registered name**: a `require_approval` or `exempt` entry, an approval prompt,
  and a query on the audit or step store's `tool_name`. A `require_approval`
  entry left on the function name no longer matches, so that tool runs without
  approval.

### Removed

- `SpecToolset` and `SpecCapability` no longer take the mount-level channel keywords
  `query_params=`, `tool_query_params=`, `url_kwargs=` and `tool_url_kwargs=`;
  passing one raises `TypeError`. A spec declares the channels it reads with `reads=`
  on the spec itself, and a value the server supplies goes in
  `tool_server_arguments`.
- `django_spec_agents.spec_tools` exports `AgentConventions`, `SpecCapability` and
  `SpecToolset` only. `AgentDeps` comes from `django_spec_agents`, and `QueryParam`
  and `UrlKwarg` from `rest_framework_services`; the `spec_tools.types` modules for
  them are gone.
